# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.

  plugins:
    - dart_code_metrics
  # Exclude generated files and build outputs from analysis
  exclude:

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.

    # Style rules

# Formatter Configuration
# The Dart formatter is configured via command-line flags or IDE settings.
# Default line length: 80 characters (configured in .cursor.config.json)
# 
# To format all Dart files:
#   dart format .
# 
# To format specific files:
#   dart format lib/
# 
# To check formatting without modifying files:
#   dart format --set-exit-if-changed .
#
# The formatter automatically handles:
# - Indentation (2 spaces)
# - Line breaks
# - Spacing around operators
# - Import ordering (handled by directives_ordering lint rule)
